# Turtle-Dash
A code that accepts the number of participants participating in the race and races them; only the **participants competing here are turtles**! The user randomly chooses a number *between 2 and 10* and sits back to see which among them wins the race. Turtles, here, can be distinguished based on their colors.  
  
We used the `turtle` module to frame the game, which comes pre-installed with python and uses the tkinter module for its visualization, which makes the code devoid of any requirements. *Obviously the turtle reminds of **Logo***.
